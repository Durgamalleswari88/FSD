FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT(BACK END):

-Full stack developers must have knowledge of an entire technology stack, i.e., the set of technologies that are used to build an end-to-end application quickly and efficiently. For example, if they want to build an application using the MEAN stack, they should know how to work with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.
-Full stack developers should be able to judge whether the selected technologies are the right choice for their project during the early phases.
